      <h1>Work</h1>
      <p>As a designer, I focus on the process of understanding the audience and needs of a given project before actually putting pen to paper, or fingers to keyboard as the case may be.</p>
      <p>My workflow usually follows this path: <a href="/process">research &rsaquo; sketching &rsaquo; wireframing &rsaquo; visual design &rsaquo; development &raquo; delivery</a>. For the last year or so, whenever possible and allowed by the client, I have skipped Photoshop as an intermediate step of creating high-fidelity mockups. The needs of designing for multiple devices makes going into Photoshop a less efficient process for me, I can better judge the nuances of layout, typography and interactions through actual working prototypes.</p>
