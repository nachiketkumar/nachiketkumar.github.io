title: Journey on Rails

The question of whether a graphic designer should know how to code has been discussed many times over, with good arguments made for both sides. For example, see [Web Designers Who Can't Code](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/web-designers-who-cant-code/ "Web Designers Who Can't Code") and [Designers Shouldn't Code](http://intenseminimalism.com/2011/designers-shouldnt-code-the-digital-duo/ "Designers Shouldn't Code"). 

Without rehashing the same arguments, I believe that if one wants to be a solid designer with a focus on on web design, then it is imperative to at the very least understand front-end development (<span class="small">HTML</span>, <span class="small">CSS</span> and maybe some <span class="small">JS</span>), if not be handy at it.

I think I'm pretty handy at it but I have a lot of room for improvement. So when I came across the opportunity to attend [HackerYou's](http://hackeryou.com "Hacker You") summer academy to learn Ruby on Rails, I jumped on it. I will be spending the next 2 months at the [Shopify](http://shopify.com) office in Ottawa, working with some awesome people, and hopefully my front end-dev skills will be all the better for it.

Rails, being a full stack web development framework, includes <span class="small">HTML</span> and <span class="small">CSS</span>. In order to build a functioning application, and one that is visually pleasing as well, will require me to improve my skills in front-end development. I am really excited to get started, and can't wait to see where I finish at the end of August!
