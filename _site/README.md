# My Jekyll-based website

In an attempt to share my process with anyone that is interested, this is the source for my new website, built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 


This site can be viewed at [nachiketkumar.com](http://nachiketkumar.com).

Jekyll builds the site in the `_site` folder, which I have added to my `.gitignore` file since the generated site itself is extraneous.

I am sure there are ways I could optimize it further, and I would love to hear suggestions- please open an issue or a pull request.

I can be reached by [email](mailto:nk@nachiketkumar.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/nachiketkumar).
